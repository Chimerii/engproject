    <p class="scribetalk">"Dear knight, you must understand: In the face of other angels and their great world, my punishment has made me akin to a worm."</p>

    <p class="scribetalk">"I can only wriggle and reach out blindly in hope that you will return to me what was once mine. I have wandered aimlessly before, and after hearing of you, I kneel before you as my savior or my end."</p>

    <p class="knighttalk">“Last night my army and I fell asleep in a barn half-burned by the warlord. The barn was owned by a kind man who lent it to us after we stopped the fire and saved his livestock. I did so with the strength of this wing.”</p>

    <p class="knighttalk">“You’re a stranger to me. I’ve never met you nor heard of you. There’s no indication of your heroism or right to take this from me. With great respect, I don’t owe you anything!”</p>

    <p class="knighttalk">”I need any help for my campaign I can take. Follow me, angel, but know that your silence will make me doubt your virtue. If we defeat the warlord together, then I’ll give you my wing.”</p>

    <p class="knighttalk">The Knight and his crew laughed at me as they said that this was perfectly normal to their culture.</p>

    <p class="scribetalk">“Were all mortals sinners? Were they cast into the sea, too?” I wondered. What they were doing was in no way normal.</p>

    <p class="scribetalk">I had no spirit to argue with them any longer, as I was exhausted from the day’s earlier work. I left them to their celebration of sin, and when the smells and noise of the feast and songs further accosted my senses, I moved to the other side of the camp.</p>
