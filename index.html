    <p>things to do:</p>
         <ol>
      <li>move site to github or somewhere where there's no watermark</li>
      <li>remove all placeholders (the blue child and current dialogue)</li>
        <li>to add to above: make a proper script</li>
      <li>add animations to certain images(?)</li>
      <li>make talksprite and cutscene images for the knight (the other character)</li>
      <li>finish cutscene art for the scribe (existing character)</li>
      <li>add a back button when viewing cutscene art (if i can figure out how to)</li>
    </ol>
      <p>ideally the script will be finished in the next week, and the art will be made gradulally over the next two weeks. adding coding flairs to the site is least important but still a huge personal goal. (i am a beginner coder so i also want to use this as a learning opportunity for myself!)</p>
     <p> this site combines elements of a comic and short story. the protagonist, the scribe, takes inspiration from <em>the overcoat</em> in that they are extremely desperate to get their missing wing back.</p>
